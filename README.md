# LocalLibrary

This web application creates an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

I really didnt like configuring my .pug files. I wanted to to use tabs for my identations for all my view files but because I started with spaces, I had to remain consistent with all the .pug files throughout the project. Also, implementing my updates and referencing my controller to make sure it make get and post correctly.

In reality, I feel very confident in this project than other semesters, because we had recognized a problem and throughout the weeks slowly built and ran it to make sure it was working correctly. Also, HEROKU is widely used web server service I would be looking at in the future for my personal web projects.
